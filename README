KDE Remote Desktop Connection
=============================

KDE Remote Desktop Connection (krdc) is a small VNC-compatible client
that is based on the TightVNC Unix client.  You can use it to access
VNC-compatible servers like KDE's Desktop Sharing (krfb). 

Its focus is on being small and as easy to use as possible. Therefore
it does not have many capabilities that may be useful in classrooms or
for tasks like system administration (like receiving 'broadcasts' of
a remote desktop, viewing several desktops at once, tabs to switch between 
desktops). In the future I plan to make the backend a KPart so that
it is possible to write a more complex clients while sharing code with
krdc.

Planned major features
----------------------

Before 3.1:
- use pixmap buffer in backend (faster refreshs)
- scaling (fit desktop into window)
- better integration with Desktop Sharing (krfb) invitations

Maybe before 3.1:
- make backend a KPart

After 3.1:
- encrypted connections
- new authentication methods
- different (non-VNC) backends. I am thinking about embedding Xnest. 
  Then it would connect to the remote machine using ssh and start some 
  script (like startkde).
