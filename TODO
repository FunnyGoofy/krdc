- optional down-scaling if remote desktop is too large for window
- animated autohide for fullscreen toolbar
- stop fs toolbar autohide timeout when mouse is over the toolbar
- add function to vncviewer code to de-allocate resources
- dont quit after failed connect attempt but allow re-try
- make sure vidmode compiles on non-XF86 servers
- security audit of the protocol code

Future:
- better cursor encoding
- login with user's name+password?
- SSL/TLS?


Known bugs/problems:
- Switching between fullscreen and normal mode can cause crashes with a
  backtrace somewhere deep in Qt
- when using the XShm extension (see DesktopInit(), CreateShmImage() invocation)
  I get error messages like "Xlib: unexpected async reply (sequence 0x1717)!" after
  a few seconds. That's why XShm is not used at the moment.
