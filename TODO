- find out when remote cursor lags and turn local cursor on
- security audit of the protocol code

Future:
- SLP browsing
- X11 support
 - patch xnest to allow embedding it into a QXEmbed
 - add exec feature to kio_fish or maybe use KSshProcess?
- SASL protocol extension?
- SSL/TLS?


Known bugs/problems:
- Switching between fullscreen and normal mode can cause crashes with a
  backtrace somewhere deep in Qt
- when using the XShm extension (see DesktopInit(), CreateShmImage() 
  invocation) I get error messages like "Xlib: unexpected async reply 
  (sequence 0x1717)!" after a few seconds. That's why XShm is not used at 
  the moment.
