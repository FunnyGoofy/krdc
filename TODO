- animated autohide for fullscreen toolbar
- stop fs toolbar autohide timeout when mouse is over the toolbar
- add function to vncviewer code to de-allocate resources
- dont quit after failed connect attempt but allow re-try
- make sure vidmode compiles on non-XF86 servers
- security audit of the protocol code

Future:
- better cursor encoding
- login with user's name+password?
- SSL/TLS?


Known bugs/problems:
- Switching between fullscreen and normal mode can cause crashes with a
  backtrace somewhere deep in Qt
- when using the XShm extension (see DesktopInit(), CreateShmImage() invocation)
  I get error messages like "Xlib: unexpected async reply (sequence 0x1717)!" after
  a few seconds. That's why XShm is not used at the moment.
- when switching to 'scaled mode' (left button on toolbar in window mode), making
  the window smaller than the framebuffer and turning the 'scaled mode' off the
  scrollbars will not be displayed until the user resizes the window. I dont know
  why and cannot find a work-around.
