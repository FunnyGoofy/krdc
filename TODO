For 3.1:
- security audit of the protocol code

For 3.2:
- SASL authentication
- X11 support
 - patch xnest to allow embedding it into a QXEmbed
 - add exec feature to kio_fish or maybe use KSshProcess?

Future:
- SSL/TLS?
- make KVncView a KPart
- possibly reduce flickering by bundling bitblts


Known bugs/problems:
- when krdc is in fullscreen and another window pops up, it may lock 
  (unconfirmed)
- when using the XShm extension (see DesktopInit(), CreateShmImage() 
  invocation) I get error messages like "Xlib: unexpected async reply 
  (sequence 0x1717)!" after a few seconds. That's why XShm is not used at 
  the moment.
