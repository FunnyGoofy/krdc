Known bugs/problems:
- Switching between fullscreen and normal mode can cause crashes with a
  backtrace somewhere deep in Qt
- at least on some KWin versions the minimize button in fullscreen hides the 
  window (does not appear in window/task lists). KWin-bug, probably.
- when using the XShm extension (see DesktopInit(), CreateShmImage() invocation)
  I get error messages like "Xlib: unexpected async reply (sequence 0x1717)!" after
  a few seconds. That's why XShm is not used at the moment
