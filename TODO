- dont quit after failed connect attempt but allow re-try
- make sure vidmode compiles on non-XF86 servers
- security audit of the protocol code

Future:
- better cursor encoding
- login with user's name+password?
- SSL/TLS?


Known bugs/problems:
- Switching between fullscreen and normal mode can cause crashes with a
  backtrace somewhere deep in Qt
- when using the XShm extension (see DesktopInit(), CreateShmImage() 
  invocation) I get error messages like "Xlib: unexpected async reply 
  (sequence 0x1717)!" after a few seconds. That's why XShm is not used at 
  the moment.
- when switching to 'scaled mode' (left button on toolbar in window mode), 
  making the window smaller than the framebuffer and turning the 'scaled 
  mode' off the scrollbars will not be displayed until the user resizes 
  the window. I dont know why and cannot find a work-around.
- in fullscreen mode the auto-hide toolbar makes problems: Mouse movements
  are only recognized while a mouse button is pressed (and no, i did no forget
  to turn on mouse tracking)
